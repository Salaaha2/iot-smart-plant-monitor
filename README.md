# IoT Smart Plant Environment Monitoring System

## Overview
This project builds an IoT system that monitors environmental conditions
(temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) and recommends optimal watering
for plants.

## Goals
- Collect sensor data using Arduino/ESP32
- Send data via WiFi
- Store historical readings
- Visualize with dashboard
- Provide watering recommendations

## Tech Stack

- Sensors (temperature, soil moisture)
- Python backend
- Web dashboard

## Repository Structure
- hardware/ → wiring and components
- firmware/ → microcontroller code
- server/ → backend services
- dashboard/ → visualization
- docs/ → documentation
- tests/ → testing

## Milestones
